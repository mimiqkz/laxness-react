# Laxness react
<img width="20%" alt="capture" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19761446/38313302-3fabbe08-3813-11e8-93e3-e4f6f8a78ae5.PNG"> ***Tilvitnun Dagsins*** is an app that displays daily quotes and insights from *Halldór Laxness*. The app is being developed in partnership with *Gljúfrasteinn*, who will supply us with the quotes. The app will use push notifications to display the daily quote to the user. Once the user opens the app, they will be able to see more information related to the quote and the museum *Gljúfrasteinn*.
 
 ## Design
 The backend of the application is connected to the [API](https://github.com/mimiqkz/laxnessapi) in which the server is hosted on Heroku.
 The application itself is availble to download at [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gljufrasteinn.ordskaldsins)
 
The UI of the application is designed with the inspiration of the *Gljúfrasteinn* website, while incorporating Android UI design principles.
